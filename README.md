# Deforestation
Deforestation project (Udacity)

This project uses data from the Global Forest Watch database, which contains information about the tree cover loss in different regions across the world. The data is stored in a SQLite database, and the project tasks involve writing SQL queries to extract and analyze the data.

The project starts by providing a database schema and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). I had to analyze various aspects of the data such as calculating the total tree cover loss in a specific region, identifying the causes of deforestation, and analyzing the impact of different factors on tree cover loss.

Throughout the project, I learned how to use various SQL commands such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING to query the database and extract relevant information, as well as how to use aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, and MAX to perform calculations on the data.
